# Crook Web site

This is the source for the Crook website.

If you have write access, you can edit the front page (for example)

* go into the `_src` folder and find `index.md`
* find the edit (pencil) button above the file contents, right hand side
* select `Edit in place`
* edit, and then `Commit changes`
* wait a minute or so and check your changes [on statichost](https://crookmorris-www.statichost.eu/) 
* Send Dave a message to update the live site (this step is hopefully temporary!)

The format is Markdown which should be quite easy to figure out. [Here is some help]((https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax))

Events have a special format `{% event %}` which I've added to markdown so Github can't render it. Best to copy and paste an existing one.
