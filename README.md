# Crook Web site

This is the source for the Crook website.

If you have write access, you can edit pages in your web browser

* go into the `_src` folder and find the page you want
* find the edit (pencil) button above the file contents, right hand side
* select `Edit in place`
* edit, and then `Commit changes`
* Now github will build the site with your changes in. Go to [the actions tab](https://github.com/crookmorris/www/actions) to see progress if you like. 
* After a minute or so your changes should be live.

Here is a direct link to [edit the front page](https://github.com/crookmorris/www/edit/main/_src/index.md)

The format is Markdown which should be quite easy to figure out. [Here is some help]((https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax))

Events have a special format `{% event %}` which I've added to markdown so Github can't render it. Best to copy and paste an existing one.
