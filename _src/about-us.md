title: About us
---
We are an assorted group of people with various interests as well as morris dancing including walking, cycling, and many other hobbies. Lots of us have jobs and some are retired. Crook are very friendly and inclusive to all.

As well as dancing with Crook, several of our members also dance with other teams. It's not just Morris dancing either, Clog Dancing, Appalachian Dancing and Garland Dancing are all part of their repertoire.

We also enjoy ceilidh dancing, where we can really let our hair down, and our musicians never miss out on a chance to join a session in a pub! 

### Why Crook?

Crook Morris was originally formed in 1981 as an offshoot from the [Crook Folk Dance Group](https://crookfdg.co.uk/), which is still active in the small village of Crook outside Kendal.

Members of Crook are sometimes known as Crooks. This is mostly a coincidence.

## Our dances

Every local Morris side develops its own distinctive style over time. In the early 20th century, many of these local traditions, especially in the Cotswolds, were captured and written down. These styles tend to define the Morris that people think of today, and our repertoire includes dances from these traditions, but they are just one part of a diverse range of performance dances from all over England.

Our total repertoire numbers around 50 dances, from over 20 different traditions, including our own. We choose about 30 of these each year to practice and perform.

### Cotswold

This is the classic Morris dance style with dancers in flowery hats, waving white hankies or clashing sticks (or both!)

### Border

### Rapper

Rapper dancing comes from the North East of England. Five dancers with flexible swords - fast and furious!

### Mumming

Mumming plays where the dragon is killed and Saint George always wins - in spite of everything.
