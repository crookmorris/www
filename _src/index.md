Crook Morris is a mixed Morris side based in Kendal, Cumbria.
We formed in 1981 as an off shoot from Crook Folk dance group. 

We practice on Monday nights dusring the winter months (October till March).
During the summer we perform at local 
pubs, fates, events, and festivals. We also travel further around the country to festivals and even 
sometimes abroad! We are an assorted group of people with various interests as well as morris dancing 
including walking, cycling, and many other hobbies. Lots of us have jobs and some are retired. Crook 
are very friendly and inclusive to all.

We have friends all over the place. We do mean friends. Lifelong friendships have developed from 
meeting other dancers at festivals, concerts and weekends which we have arranged and invited other 
Morris dancers. As well as dancing with Crook, several of our members also dance with other teams. 
It's not just Morris dancing either, Clog Dancing, Appalachian Dancing and Garland Dancing are all 
part of their repertoire. We also enjoy ceilidh dancing, where we can really let our hair down, and 
our musicians never miss out on a chance to join a session in a pub!
