Event help for editors
   
   First line:
   {% event 'yyyy-mm-dd' %}
       - for a one day event
   {% event 'yyyy-mm-dd' 'note' %}
       - for a one day event with note (e.g. "tbc")
   {% event 'yyyy-mm-dd' '' 'Special BIG date' %}
       - for a multi day event
         or if for some other reason you need to show a different date 
         (in this case yyyy-mm-dd should be the last day of the event
         so it can be hidden automatically when the event is over)
   {% event 'yyyy-mm-dd' 'note' 'Special BIG date' %}
       - for a multi day event with note

   Next lines: any markdown like the rest of the page.
   This is usually a link to the venue and a short description.
   You can also use images, with
   ![alt text](http://image link/)
   this should be on its own line.
   Upload images somewhere in the assets/ folder.
