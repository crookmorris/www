## Book us for your event

We are happy to come and dance at local pubs, events and festivals during the summer season (roughly April until September.) We're lucky to have a fair number of dancers and musicians but it's always best to get us booked in early!


[Contact our squire](mailto:squire@crookmorris.org.uk) to make an enquiry.

## Get involved

We are a friendly and inclusive side and welcome all new faces!

We practice on Monday nights from October until March, then during the summer we perform at local pubs, events and festivals.

If you'd like to try out morris or rapper dancing, look out for our taster day, held in Kendal in September before the practice season begins. All are welcome to come and have a go with no commitment.

[Send us a message](mailto:squire@crookmorris.org.uk) to find out more.
