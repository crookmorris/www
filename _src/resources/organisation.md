## How we are organised

On the whole we have a relaxed and easy-going attitude to running the side. We run our affairs by consensus between all members, listen to comments and suggestions and settle any issues by informal discussion with everyone involved.
 
A number of officers are voted in at our AGM in September who are responsible for carrying out the side’s wishes. Officers can be either musicians or dancers.

### Roles

* _Squire &mdash;_ the leader and organiser of the side, and usually the first point of contact for the public and for other Morris sides. Each Squire serves for 2 years. In the second year of office, we vote in a Squire-Elect, who then has a year shadowing the current Squire and preparing for office. The Squire is responsible for organising the side when we are dancing out in the summer, and when we attend festivals etc.
* _Foreman &mdash;_ responsible for teaching the dances, and for organising and controlling practice sessions. The Foreman decides upon the dance repertoire, in consultation with the Squire, and makes the decisions about who will dance in display sets and paid bookings.
* _Treasurer &mdash;_ looks after the side’s money, pays the side’s bills and is responsible for collecting subs, noting attendance, and collecting money for camping, festival fees etc. The Treasurer prepares an annual report on our finances for the AGM.
* _Secretary &mdash;_ does the general admin and correspondence, updates contact details, takes minutes, books venues, and sends out information and reminders as the Squire requests.
* _Publicity Officer &mdash;_ handles any press releases and interaction with the media, sorts out the layout and printing of leaflets and flyers, and organises the advertising of any events that we put on.
* _“Bunny Parents” &mdash;_ take care of sending cards and/or flowers when members are ill or injured, get married, produce offspring etc.

For special events (ceilidhs, holidays etc) we form a sub-committee of volunteers to organise and report back to the side.

### Membership and subscription rates

Subscriptions cover the general running of the side and hire of the practice hall.

* Full Members of Crook currently pay a subscription of £25 per year.
* Members at a Distance – those involved but not Full Members - pay £12.50.
* Those in full-time education pay half the full or Member-at-a-Distance rate as appropriate.

Subs must be paid before the end of October.

### New members

After a public taster day in September, we welcome new members to our first winter practices starting in October. The first 4 sessions are offered free, so that you can try dancing or playing to see if you like it. After this time, if you wish to become a member you need to pay your subs. New members may join at other times of the year but need to pay subs at the first opportunity.

As a member of Crook, you will receive certain items to enable you to prepare your kit (e.g., bells, hankies, material for baldricks), but will be expected to provide your own shirts, britches etc. See [the kit list](../kit/) for full details.

### Attendance

To enable us to put on a polished display, we expect dancers and musicians to attend as many practices as possible. When at paid bookings or festivals, the Squire, Foreman and lead musician will decide who dances and plays for each dance. At Monday dance-outs we try to get as many people dancing and playing as possible.

### Subsidy

Crook is keen to encourage members to travel to events and festivals, so we provide an annual subsidy to help defray some of the costs involved. To qualify for this subsidy, you must have paid your subs and have attended the majority (50 %) of the winter practice sessions. The subsidy covers the costs of entry to certain festivals, and some camping costs, which will vary from year to year. It is not transferable to events such as the Christmas meal and cannot be taken in cash or carried over to the next year. If you do not qualify for the subsidy, you are welcome to attend festivals and events, but will have to pay your own costs.

### Kit

We ask both dancers and musicians to
wear correct kit when appearing in
public. See [the kit list](../kit/) for full details.

### Social Events

We are a very sociable side, and we try to do other things together during the course of the year. Past events have included days playing croquet and boules, walks in the Lakes, and bunkhouse weekends. We celebrated our 30th birthday year with a weekend away at a Youth Hostel, a big party weekend, and a social weekend in Dent. In the past we have organised holidays abroad, and an example of one of these trips was a visit to the Vendee in July 2012. We have also been to various regions of France, and Western Ireland, visiting Kendal's twin town (although it wasn't when we went!)
