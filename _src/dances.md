We perform dances from many different traditions and have a total repertoire of 
around 50 dances although select around only 30 each year to practice and perform.

## Cotswold

This is the classic Morris dance style with dancers in flowery hats, waving white hankies or clashing sticks (or both!)

Rapper dancing comes from the North East of England. Five dancers with flexible swords - fast and furious!
